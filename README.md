## Limitations

The latest version is **BETA** release.
This includes the below significant limitations as below:

* Default commit setting does not guarantee the committed data are durable, they will be saved to disks a short time after (about tens to hundreds of milliseconds)

  * You can change this setting ([tsurugi.ini](dist/install/conf/tsurugi.ini)) by `commit_response` in `[sql]` section. The current setting is `AVAILABLE` (committed data is visible for other transactions), and we planed it to be `STORED` (committed data has been saved on the local disk).

* Available SQL features are very limited, please see [available feature list](docs/sql-features.md).
* User control does not work, including authentications and authorizations.
